Blending
-see doom logo
-what if we are blending correctly, but the texture loading bug causes the blending to produce weird results?
--maybe pursue the texture bug first??

Texture loading
-see level 1 walls and floors
-idImageManager::AllocImage() seems to be loading the correct order
-next, check idImageManager::ImageFromFile()

Missing active entities
-activeEntities in idGameLocal::RunFrame() is 170 != 139~140
    -interesting...the differenceis the exact number of entities that SHOULD be deactivated below
    -luckily they're the last ~30 elements in the list, so we just add a size counter to the original, and see where they're added!!1One
