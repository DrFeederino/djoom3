# DOOM3 Kotlin

Inspired by [DJOOM 3 by Blackbeard334](https://github.com/blackbeard334/djoom3/)
</br>
Compilation is recommended under Azul JDK 17 & Kotlin ver. 1.7.0.

#### 21-06-2022

Version 0.0.1

This version is the first milestone: re-write djoom 3 in kotlin.
</br>
A lot of stuff works to my surprise, however, currently it only compiles and does some basic initializing stuff. Fails
at Script Compiling.
</br>
Next version will feature at least playable menu, hopefully :)

Version 0.0.2
</br>
-Fixed Script Compilation
</br>
-Moved to Java 17 and Kotlin 1.7.0
</br>
-Fixed nasty Filesystem issues (e.g. )
