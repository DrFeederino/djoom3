# DOOM3 Kotlin

Inspired by [DJOOM 3 by Blackbeard334](https://github.com/blackbeard334/djoom3/)
Currently being moved to Kotlin Native.

#### 21-06-2022

Version 0.0.1

This version is the first milestone: re-write djoom 3 in kotlin.
A lot of stuff works to my surprise, however, currently it only compiles and does some basic initializing stuff. Fails
at Script Compiling. Next version will feature at least playable menu, hopefully :)
